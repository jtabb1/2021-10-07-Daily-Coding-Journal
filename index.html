    <p> 
      Today I did some coding and ran some errands.  I am not 
      too disappointented in how much I got done, although I did 
      want to get one feature done by today which looks like 
      it will be pushed back to tomorrow.
    </p> 

    <p> 
      Tomorrow I plan to (3) work on getting my Flatiron project hosted, 
      (5) start my Amazon coding project, (1) run a couple of errands, 
      (4) go to the gym, and (2) work on that feature (new ui with 
      "common_todos" table).  Maybe I'll also (6) put in for an expedited 
      motion on a failure to pay rent complaint too.  I 
      have prioritized this list with "(#)'s'" as noted.
